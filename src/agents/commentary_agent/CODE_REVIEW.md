The commentary agent component is well-designed with excellent session management and natural conversation flow. The recent session-aware improvements make it production-ready.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Review

### **Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Session-aware context continuity** - Eliminates repetitive commentary
- ‚úÖ Clean ADK Agent pattern with proper tool usage
- ‚úÖ Professional two-person broadcast dialogue generation
- ‚úÖ Good separation between tools, prompts, and main agent
- ‚úÖ Excellent prompt engineering for session awareness
- ‚úÖ Robust JSON response formatting and error handling

### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor import path issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some hard-coded fallback values
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Nested JSON structure in session-aware outputs

## üìÅ Component Analysis

### **`commentary_agent.py`** - Main Agent Implementation
**Status: Excellent with session awareness**

**Issues:**
- Relative imports for data agent tools (line 58)
- Hard-coded fallback game ID

**Recommendations:**
```python
# Current
from ..data_agent.tools import load_static_context

# Improved
try:
    from src.agents.data_agent.tools import load_static_context
except ImportError:
    logger.warning("Could not import data agent tools")
    load_static_context = lambda x: {}
```

**Strengths:**
- Clean agent factory function
- Good static context integration
- Excellent callback implementation for response formatting

### **`prompts.py`** - Session-Aware Prompt Engineering
**Status: Excellent prompt design**

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Session awareness instructions** - Clear guidance on context continuity
- ‚úÖ Professional broadcast standards
- ‚úÖ Clear tool usage requirements
- ‚úÖ Good error handling instructions

**Issues:**
- None significant - well-crafted prompts

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding game situation-specific prompt variations

### **`tools.py`** - Commentary Generation Tools
**Status: Good tool design with minor improvements needed**

**Issues:**
- Bare except clause in static context loading (line 32)
- Hard-coded fallback values
- Inconsistent return data structures

**Recommendations:**
```python
# Current
except:
    static_context = {}

# Improved
except (ImportError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to load static context: {e}")
    static_context = _get_default_context()
```

**Strengths:**
- Clean tool function implementations
- Good commentary type determination logic
- Professional speaker name mapping
- Varied dialogue generation for different intensities

## üéØ Session Management Excellence

### **Key Innovation: Session-Aware Commentary**
The session-aware implementation is a major strength:

```python
# Session continuity in prompts.py
"You are part of an ONGOING BROADCAST SESSION - maintain conversation continuity"
"REMEMBER previous commentary in this session to avoid repetition"
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation flow across timestamps
- ‚úÖ No repetitive welcome messages
- ‚úÖ Building narrative and context awareness
- ‚úÖ Professional broadcast quality

### **Session Implementation Quality:**
- Uses single session across multiple timestamps
- Proper context initialization
- Good memory of previous commentary
- Natural dialogue progression

## üéØ Tool Function Analysis

### **`generate_two_person_commentary`**
**Status: Core function working well**

**Strengths:**
- Good momentum-based commentary type selection
- Professional speaker role differentiation
- Realistic timing and duration estimates
- Context-aware dialogue generation

**Issues:**
- Could improve error handling for missing data

### **`format_commentary_for_audio`**
**Status: Good audio preparation**

**Strengths:**
- Audio-ready formatting
- Voice style mapping
- Duration calculations
- Proper metadata structure

### **`analyze_commentary_context`**
**Status: Good analysis logic**

**Strengths:**
- Smart context analysis
- Good strategy determination
- Clean metadata generation

## üéØ Response Formatting Quality

### **JSON Structure:**
The agent produces well-structured output:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "commentary_type": "HIGH_INTENSITY",
  "commentary_sequence": [...],
  "total_duration_estimate": 24.5,
  "for_audio_agent": {...}
}
```

**Issues:**
- Session-aware outputs have nested structure that could be flattened
- Some redundant data in output format

## üîß Minor Issues to Fix

### **1. Import Path Cleanup**
```python
# Current
from ..data_agent.tools import load_static_context

# Improved
try:
    from src.agents.data_agent.tools import load_static_context
except ImportError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to import data agent tools: {e}")
    load_static_context = lambda game_id: {}
```

### **2. Error Handling Improvement**
```python
# Current
except:
    static_context = {}

# Improved
except (ImportError, FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Static context load failed: {e}")
    static_context = {"game_info": {"game_id": game_id}}
```

### **3. Response Structure Simplification**
Consider flattening the nested JSON structure in session-aware outputs.

## üéØ Production Readiness

### **Ready for Production:**
- ‚úÖ Session-aware implementation works excellently
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation flow
- ‚úÖ Professional broadcast quality
- ‚úÖ Good error handling and fallbacks
