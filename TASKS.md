## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **ADK Learning Curve**: Start with simple agent communication
- **Google Cloud Costs**: Use free tier, monitor usage
- **Real-time Performance**: Test with mock data first
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and fallbacks

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on MVP first
- **Integration Issues**: Test components individually
- **Last-minute Bugs**: Leave buffer time for fixes
- **Demo Preparation**: Start video early

## üìä Success Metrics
