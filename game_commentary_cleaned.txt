================================================================================

‚è∞ 1_00_00
----------------------------------------
Play-By-Play: We are underway here at Rogers Place! And what a start, folks, nine goals already!
Analyst: That's right. The Panthers with a slight 5-4 edge early in this first period. Absolutely no feeling-out process here!
Play-By-Play: Barkov wins the opening faceoff against Draisaitl. A key matchup we'll be watching closely all game long.
Analyst: Indeed. Both teams known for their offensive firepower, but I wonder if we'll see adjustments to tighten things up defensively after this initial flurry.

‚è∞ 1_00_05
----------------------------------------
Analyst: Looking at the season so far, the Panthers have been strong on the road, boasting a 15-8-3 record away from home.
Play-By-Play: And the Oilers, as usual, are tough to beat here in Edmonton. Their home record stands at 18-6-2. A definite advantage.
Analyst: Florida's coming off a big win against Calgary, while Edmonton dropped their last game to Vancouver. Momentum is a funny thing...
Play-By-Play: No kidding. But a fresh start here tonight! We'll see if either of those recent results has a lingering effect.

‚è∞ 1_00_10
----------------------------------------
Play-By-Play: Five minutes in, and the pace remains incredibly high! Both goalies have been tested early and often.
Analyst: You're not kidding. This isn't exactly the goaltending duel we anticipated coming into tonight's game.
Play-By-Play: Quick reminder that Sergei Bobrovsky is in net for the Panthers, facing off against Stuart Skinner for the Oilers.
Analyst: Both are capable of stealing games, so expect them to settle in eventually. This scoring rate is unsustainable, right?

‚è∞ 1_00_15
----------------------------------------

Analyst: Close doesn't count, but that's a sign the Panthers are buzzing early, creating chances and putting pressure on Edmonton's defense.

----------------------------------------

Play-By-Play: Kapanen with another hit on Ekblad! He's been a frequent target early on here tonight.

‚è∞ 1_00_40
----------------------------------------
Play-By-Play: Penalty! Kane goes to the box for high-sticking Verhaeghe. That's a costly penalty for the Oilers.

Play-By-Play: Big opportunity for the Panthers to extend their lead here. Their power play has been clicking lately.
Analyst: Edmonton needs a strong penalty kill here. Can't afford to give up an easy goal and let Florida build momentum.

‚è∞ 1_01_20
----------------------------------------
Analyst: Edmonton's giving up too many quality scoring chances. They need to limit the Panthers' opportunities if they want to get back in this game.
Play-By-Play: Skinner is standing tall, though, keeping them within one. He's been tested early and often.

‚è∞ 1_01_35
----------------------------------------

‚è∞ 1_01_40

‚è∞ 1_01_45

‚è∞ 1_02_00
----------------------------------------
Play-By-Play: Let's talk about the goaltending situation here. Bobrovsky and Skinner have both had their moments.

‚è∞ 1_02_25
----------------------------------------

Play-By-Play: It's going to take a sustained effort to break through. Can't just rely on individual plays.

‚è∞ 1_02_50
----------------------------------------
Analyst: Despite giving up five goals, Bobrovsky has actually been pretty solid. The Oilers have been throwing everything they've got at him.
Play-By-Play: You can't fault him for the effort. The Oilers are outshooting the Panthers by a significant margin.
